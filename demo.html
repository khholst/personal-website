            <p>Video's script:</p>
            <p>This is a demo video of a Philadelpia public transport application, which uses a public API to get data about vehicles and then it visualises the data on a interactive map. So, at first you get an option to choose a bus or a trolley route and all the active routes are in the dropdown. If you choose a route then you can see all of the vehicles en route right now. Here you can see that on line 4 all these buses are active and if we'd zoom in, we'd actually see them moving. And you can select a specific vehicle to get more information about it such as direction, destination, next stop, timing and seats, which in this case is unknown. And another feature is that you can switch on to the trains if you click the train button here. Now the buses all dissapear and you can choose a live rail route. For example, let's choose this one and now we see all trains that are currently active on this line. And similarly to the buses, we can click on them and see some additional information. And when you zoom in close enough, you can also see the train stations and also with the buses you can see the bus stations on a specific route. If you zoom in to a scale then you can see the bus stations. And yeah, that's about it.</p>
